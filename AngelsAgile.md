# Angel's Agile Software Development Methodology (V0.2)

## Core processes:
- Plan
- Design
- Develop
- Test
- Review

Remember that any of this can be changed to fit your use case.

## Plan
The planning phase is a collaborative effort to set a shared vision for the project. The team, alongside stakeholders and product owners, defines business objectives, desired outcomes, and priorities. Requirements are captured mainly as user stories focused on value to the user, and not as exhaustive specifications. Planning is treated as a collaborative activity, integrating flexibility to welcome changes and continuously update priorities based on stakeholder feedback and evolving understanding. Hard requirements (such as compliance or immovable deadlines) are clarified openly. The main artifacts are lightweight, living documents such as:
- Product Backlog with prioritized user stories/features
- Roadmap or release plan (used for transparency, not rigid scheduling)
- Initial risk and dependency/assumption register
- Communication plan to support collaboration and feedback

## Design
Design is performed incrementally and just-in-time, ensuring the architecture and solutions are suited to delivering current priorities, not over-engineered for unneeded future scope. The team collaborates closely to design solutions that are simple yet robust, allowing for change and growth. Prototypes, wireframes, and architecture diagrams are used as communication tools. The output of design evolves with each sprint, accommodating new insights and changing requirements.
- Architecture diagrams
- Wireframes/prototypes
- API & data model definitions (as needed)
- Notes from technical spikes/discovery

## Develop
Development focuses on delivering working software in short, incremental cycles. Developers collaborate daily, ask for feedback early, and integrate code frequently. Peer reviews and pair programming may be used to encourage knowledge sharing and technical excellence. User stories are completed and tested against the definition of done, functional, and potentially shippable. Documentation is kept lean, limited to what helps others understand and use the system efficiently.
- Working code increment
- Code and configuration documentation (as needed)
- Updated test suites
- Progress tracked openly via updated boards/tools

## Test
Testing is integrated throughout the sprint; it is not a standalone late-stage activity. The team values automated tests, quick feedback, and tight communication between testers and developers. Testing ensures each story meets agreed acceptance criteria and helps uncover areas needing improvement. Feedback from testing is used immediately, and failures are seen as learning opportunities.
- Test scripts and results
- Bug/issue tracking
- Lightweight reports (if needed—otherwise visible in tooling)

## Review
Each iteration ends with a review/demonstration (sprint review), where stakeholders see what was built and provide feedback. The team then holds a retrospective to reflect on the process and identify improvements. Changes in requirements, lessons learned, and new ideas are added to the backlog for future work. This ensures the team is always learning and improving, and that product direction remains aligned with business value.
- Demo/review notes
- Feedback log
- Updated backlog (with new/changed requirements or insights)
- Retrospective actions/notes

Overall, our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
