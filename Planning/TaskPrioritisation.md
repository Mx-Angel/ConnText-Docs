# Task Prioritisation

## Overview
This document outlines the tasks and their priority level for the project. This project will use the Value vs Effort matrix to determine the priority of tasks.

## Tasks and Priorities

### Structure
The value vs effort matrix will be structured as a table with the following columns:
- **Task Name**: The name of the task to be completed.
- **Effort**: The estimated effort required to complete the task.
- **Value**: The value or benefit the task provides to the user or the system.
- **Quadrant**: The quadrant in the Value vs Effort matrix where the task falls

### Value vs Effort Matrix
This project uses a Value vs Effort matrix to prioritize tasks. Each task is evaluated on two dimensions which are **Value** and **Effort**. The tasks are then categorized into four quadrants based on their scores. The metrics go from low to high number, which is equivalent to low to high priority. The higher the number, the more important the task is to the project.

**Value Scale (1-5):**
- 1 = Very Low Value
- 2 = Low Value  
- 3 = Medium Value
- 4 = High Value
- 5 = Very High Value

**Effort Scale (1-5):**
- 1 = Very Low Effort
- 2 = Low Effort
- 3 = Medium Effort
- 4 = High Effort
- 5 = Very High Effort

**Resulting Quadrants:**
- **Q1**: Low Value (1-2), Low Effort (1-2) - **Fill Ins** - Do when you have spare time
- **Q2**: Low Value (1-2), High Effort (3-5) - **Time Sinks** - Avoid or de-prioritise  
- **Q3**: High Value (3-5), Low Effort (1-2) - **Quick Wins** - Do first
- **Q4**: High Value (3-5), High Effort (3-5) - **Major Projects** - Plan carefully

*All assessments are subjective and can be adjusted based on a group consensus.*
