# Task Prioritisation

## Overview
This document outlines the tasks and their priority level for the project. This project will use the Value vs Effort matrix to determine the priority of tasks.

## Tasks and Priorities

### Legend
Overall the metrics go from low to high number this equivalent to low to high priority. The higher the number, the more important the task is to the project.
- **Task Name**: The name of the task to be completed.
- **Effort**: The estimated effort required to complete the task.
- **Value**: The value or benefit the task provides to the user or the system.
- **Quadrant**: The quadrant in the Value vs Effort matrix where the task falls:
  - **Q1**: Low Value, Low Effort (Fill Ins)
  - **Q2**: Low Value, High Effort (Time Sinks)
  - **Q3**: High Value, Low Effort (Quick Wins)
  - **Q4**: High Value, High Effort (Major Projects)

### Effort and Value Measurement
Effort is measured on a scale of 1 to 5, where:
- 1 = Very Low Effort
- 2 = Low Effort
- 3 = Medium Effort
- 4 = High Effort
- 5 = Very High Effort  

Value is also measured on a scale of 1 to 5, where:
- 1 = Very Low Value
- 2 = Low Value
- 3 = Medium Value
- 4 = High Value
- 5 = Very High Value  

All of these metrics are subjective and can be adjusted based on group consensus.
