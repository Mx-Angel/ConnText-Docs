# Non-Functional Requirements Register

## Overview
This document will outline the non-functional requirements of the ConnText software. The non-functional requirements go over requirements that aren't directly related to the functionality of the software, but rather how the software should perform or execute certain functionality. This document will use [UserStories](UserStories) as a reference for features and functionalities. Additionally, these non-functional requirements will be split by their types to make it easier to find the requirements you are looking for and to make future modifications easier.
